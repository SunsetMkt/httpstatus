目前为止一切正常，客户端应该继续请求，如果已完成请求则忽略。为了让服务器检查请求的首部，客户端必须在发送请求实体前，在初始化请求中发送 `Expect: 100-continue` 首部并接收 `100 Continue` 响应状态码。

The initial part of a request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server. The server intends to send a final response after the request has been fully received and acted upon.

When the request contains an Expect header field that includes a 100-continue expectation, the 100 response indicates that the server wishes to receive the request payload body<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>. The client ought to continue sending the request and discard the 100 response.

If the request did not contain an Expect header field containing the 100-continue expectation, the client can simply discard this interim response.
