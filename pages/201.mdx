请求已经被成功处理，并且创建了新的资源。新的资源在应答返回之前已经被创建。同时新增的资源会在应答消息体中返回，其地址或者是原始请求的路径，或者是 `Location` 首部的值。

The request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created.

The primary resource created by the request is identified by either a Location header field in the response or, if no Location field is received, by the effective request URI.

The 201 response payload typically describes and links to the resource(s) created. See [Section 7.2 of RFC7231][2] for a discussion of the meaning and purpose of validator header fields, such as ETag and Last-Modified, in a 201 response.
